## Overview

This is my solution to a challenge given by frontend mentor. The challenge was to create a QR code card that links to frontend mentor's site. It needed to be responsive to desktop/mobile view and meet the original design image as much as possible. No other instructions are provided as it is up to the dev to figure out how to make the design a reality.

## My process

As always I started by placing all HTML into its proper place. I examine the head of the HTML to check for meta information and I place links to any style/script files I will need. After the HTML file is all layed out I look to simplify the HTML. I look to see if I can use semantic language instead of making several divs. After I clean up the HTML code and make sure the browser is getting the information it needs I move on to the styling in CSS. In the CSS file I start by looking over the given design image and see if there are styles used in multiple places and check for places in the design that a client may want changed in the future i.e. background colors,font styles and sizes, so on and so forth, and I make those styles into variables in the :root. After I declare my :root I move on to reset any default styling that would be applied by the browser to the HTML and it's children elements using "\*". After the default styles are cleared I start by styling the semantic tags from top of the page to the bottom. I then style and class tags, then move to id's if there are any. After all styles are placed I check for responsiveness for over 40 devices using dev tools in the browser. After this was done I move on to uploading to a repo and then finally deployment.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to focus on some of the basics of semantics. I wanted to use less div's than some of my other projects and see how I could simplify the CSS to make all of the files more understandable. I tried to never repeat style rules and I feel that I was succesful in that set goal. I learned more about how containers control the items inside of them when using flexbox and I realized that I don't use padding often and that it would have saved a lot of previous lines of code in my previous projects. Overall it was fun to step back into a simple design project and brush up on how to simplify my codes.
